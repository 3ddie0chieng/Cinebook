            The Cinema Booking system offers a fast and efficient navigation into the online ticket booking services. It will allow customers to access services of a business, reserve seats and buy digital tickets. It also acts as a digital platform that provides details such as time of the movie, what seats are available and movie previews. Cinema booking system allows users to view movie listings, select a preferred showtime, and reserve seats for their chosen film. The system typically includes a user-friendly interface where customers can browse available movies and check showtimes. Users can select their seats and proceed to payment, where they enter their details and confirm the booking. Once the payment is processed, the system generates an e-ticket or booking confirmation, which the user can present at the cinema for entry.
